# SimpleServerLogo
A Logo that Shows on the top right of your screen. Haven't seen many people make this, and I thought it would be helpful or somebody may want this.


INSTALL:
Simply just change the URL of the image in index.html, and there you go!

add `start SimpleServerLogo` to your server.cfg
